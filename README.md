# Pediatric Art Outreach Website
> A simple nonprofit website supporting pediatric art outreach, built to be reliable, clear, and easy to maintain.

---

## Features
- Static website built with plain HTML and CSS  
- Clear presentation of mission, programs, and impact  
- Lightweight design focused on readability and accessibility  
- No backend or build tools required  
- Easy for volunteers to update and extend

## Why This Exists
Small nonprofits often need a web presence, but not the overhead that comes with complex frameworks or platforms. When sites are hard to update, they quietly go stale.

This site is meant to last. It keeps the focus on the mission and makes it easy for anyone on the team to maintain without specialized technical knowledge.

---

## How It Works
The site is intentionally straightforward.

1. Content is written directly in HTML for clarity  
2. CSS handles layout, typography, and responsiveness  
3. Pages can be edited or added without touching any tooling  
4. The site can be hosted anywhere that supports static files  

There are no external dependencies that can break or become obsolete.
